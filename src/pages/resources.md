>TURN will be conducting daily video-conferencing using Zoom to discuss a variety of landlord tenant issues .  Each closed session will be for one hour and will be  limited to persons who register in advance. It will include a question and answer session with an experienced attorney and paralegal. This workshop is for information only and will not provide legal representation or advice.

## [ Philadelphia Tenants Union ](http://phillytenantsunion.org/)

We believe that unless tenants across the city band together to fight for their rights, landlords will only keep getting stronger, housing prices will continue to rise, and people will continue to be displaced from their neighborhoods.
