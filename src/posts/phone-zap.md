<!-- ![ATU Phone Zap Flier](/images/Zap_Outreach.png "Join Altman Tenant's Union Monday, June 15th and Tuesday, June 16th for a phone zap in support of Altman tenants!") -->

Please join the Altman Tenant's Union for a two-day call and email action!
The union has made several demands of Altman management, zero of which have been met. Instead, Altman has sent eviction letters out to its tenants in the middle of a pandemic. 
Our demands include 
- a reduction in rent throughout the pandemic 
- No late fees 
- Free tenants from payment plans made under coercion
- No open houses held in our building 
- Proper PPE worn by all employees and contractors working in the building
- Have locks and buzzer systems fixed where needed
- Absolutely no illegal eviction notices

We want to let Altman know that their actions are unacceptable! You can help us by simply calling or sending a form email.

From the morning of the 22th through the end of the work day on the 23th we ask that as many people as possible call in!

Address your email to [Brett Altman]( mailto:Brett@almanco.com ) and [Robert Bluth](mailto:Bob_B@altmanco.com), and then call Altman’s main office: (215) 884-0500 to let them know you’ve emailed and are concerned. You can leave a message for the office, or you can dial Ext. 149 to leave a message for Brett Altman directly.  If you are an Altman tenant, call your property manager to let them know you've emailed and are concerned. 

The template letter you can use can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwwyxLfYAvv9qz-UK0kOCV8bX8rx7GoFVYjN11u6xLc/edit). The phone script can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gwIMQPk_AUTrM-5BG1zg7gObrfJ2_I3lT_YQxkVyM5c/edit?usp=sharing).
