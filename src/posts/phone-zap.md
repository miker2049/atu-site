<!-- ![ATU Phone Zap Flier](/images/Zap_Outreach.png "Join Altman Tenant's Union Monday, June 15th and Tuesday, June 16th for a phone zap in support of Altman tenants!") -->

Please join the Altman Tenant's Union for a two-day call and email action!
The union has made several demands of Altman management, zero of which have been met. Instead, Altman has sent eviction letters out to its tenants in the middle of a pandemic. 
Our demands include 
- a reduction in rent throughout the pandemic 
- No late fees 
- Free tenants from payment plans made under coercion
- No open houses held in our building 
- Proper PPE worn by all employees and contractors working in the building
- Have locks and buzzer systems fixed where needed
- Absolutely no illegal eviction notices

We want to let Altman know that their actions are unacceptable! You can help us by simply calling or sending a form email.

From the morning of the 22th through the end of the work day on the 23th we ask that as many people as possible call in!

If you’re an Altman tenant:  Use the form letter below to write to your own individual property manager and _____(whatever head person we decide on), then call your property manager to let them know you’ve emailed and are concerned. 

If you’re a friend, family, or community member please also use the form and address your email to ____ (whoever we decide) and then call ______(#) to let them know you’ve emailed and are concerned. 

The template letter we are asking people to use can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwwyxLfYAvv9qz-UK0kOCV8bX8rx7GoFVYjN11u6xLc/edit).
