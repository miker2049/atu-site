Formed in March 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Altman's Tenant Union represents residences in Altman managed buildings across the city of Philadelphia and beyond. We are working closely with [Philadelphia Tenants Union](http://phillytenantsunion.org/), and are growing rapidly to ensure representation and support for all Altman Tenants.
